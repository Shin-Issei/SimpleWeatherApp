12:36 PM: "uuugghhhhh....my God"
Not having everything at least partially settled on in terms of the what and how is seriously slowing down my progress. At this point there shouldn't be anymore decisions to be made about how this thing is going to work. Just how it's going to look and a few implementation details. But how its going to work is only half way laid out. Its only been like 30 mins and I am already begging for a break.

1:48 PM: Next time!: 
    [] Create StyleSheet
    [] Create Search for user requested location
    [] Error Handling (try: catch: or .catch() after .then() chain?)
    [] Time function(???)

1:51 PM: Productivity note:
    How nessecary is it that I do this in a plain text format? It's getting updatated along with everything else in the project. I guess I can just throw a git ignore at it.
    Alternativley there is Notion and that is a tool that seems quite useful.
